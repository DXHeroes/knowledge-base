# Feedback

**TL;DR**

Giving and receiving honest feedback is essential at the workplace. Be as positive as possible when receiving feedback. When giving feedback, don't be too direct or too indirect. Follow the simple rules of giving feedback in this article to make sure your feedback is effective.

## What Is Feedback

One essential aspect of any work is feedback. Getting feedback can help speed up the work in the initial stages, saving many resources in the final stages. Feedback is so vital that some project architectures are formed solely on it. For instance, the Agile methodology depends heavily on the feedback of the customers, other teams, etc.

Giving or receiving feedback is not an easy task. Giving feedback without knowing the work inside out can lead to misunderstandings and, in turn, additional work. As effective as feedback is, it can be equally bad if it is not delivered right. In this article, we'll show you some ways to give or ask for feedback effectively.

## Why You Might Want the Feedback

Feedback can help you finish any work pretty quickly and efficiently. You need to have good communication skills to deliver or receive feedback effectively.

## Problems It Solves for Teams

- Feedback can help you grow both professionally and personally.
- Feedback can make your work much easier and faster.
- By identifying the good feedback, you can work on the issues and perform better.
- Feedback also helps to solve any miscommunications.

Now that we're clear on why feedback is important, let us see how to give feedback.

## How to Implement the Feedback

Giving effective feedback can be white difficult. However, once you master this art, you can help your teams succeed easily.

### Giving Feedback

#### 1. Giving Feedback through Texts

Many executives feel that video conferences are the best way to give feedback. However, it is not always necessary. After dabbling in the developer communities on Reddit, we found that many users prefer feedback given through texts on Slack or other such applications.

When the feedback is small and doesn't criticize the work done so far, it is best to give it through small text messages. However, if the feedback is vital to the project and is difficult to convey through texts, go for a video conference.

When giving feedback through texts, it is essential to use the right words. Wording a sentence the right way can save you a ton of time when giving feedback. Be careful when you are giving feedback through texts. Sometimes, it may seem like the feedback may not be important when it's giving in text messages.

#### 2. Video Conferences

If the feedback is from a client or other executives at the company, it is best to arrange a video conference to give the feedback. In a video conference, you can observe the recipients' body language and figure out how they feel about the feedback.

This becomes quite essential when the feedback can potentially change the project. Video communication also gives a chance to the developers to express their feelings about the feedback. Even though text messages can do the same to some extent, it takes a personal bond with the employee to achieve the same understanding through texts.

Through video conferences, we can eliminate misunderstandings and make the requirements crystal clear. This will help the development team as they can spend less time identifying the requirements.

#### 3. Structure the Feedback Properly

If you're in the IT field, there is a good chance that you received vague feedback more than once. Unfortunately, most of the feedback we in the IT space receive from the clients is vague or too indirect. Try to avoid this at all costs. When giving feedback, be clear about what you want to be changed or improved.

If the feedback is too indirect, the employee may not even realize what they have to do. In the worst cases, they may not even realize that it is feedback. Instead, they may see it as a casual chat and ignore the advice given to them.

On the other hand, if the feedback is too direct, it will drive the recipient to act defensively. As software engineers, we take pride in our work, and not everyone feels the same way about taking direct feedback.

When the feedback is positive, don't hesitate to praise the employee's work. However, when the feedback is negative, ensure that you are not too direct. One of the best ways to ensure that your feedback is received properly is by informing the team of the way you give feedback ahead of the project. Also, be sure to mention that you are open to taking feedback as well. This will create a feedback circle and promote an environment where negative feedback is taken and used for the good of the entire project.

#### 4. Use the Situation, Behaviour, Impact (Sbi) Framework

One of the primary reasons feedback is often ineffective is the vagueness of the feedback. If you're afraid of being too vague or too direct, you can use the SBI framework to communicate your message. This framework ensures that the recipient of the feedback knows what you're talking about. Whether they decide to take any action on it is their choice.

The SBI framework is pretty simple. When giving feedback, you refer to the key situation, the key behavior, and the impact the behavior in that situation had on your team. Let us see this framework in action with a small example.

Let's say John Doe is a full-stack engineer in your team. During a meeting with the client, John got defensive when the client asked the team to change the design of the navbar. Now, when giving feedback to John, be specific. Mention the meeting with the client as the situation. Help John understand his behavior in that situation. Tell him the impact it had. In this case, the impact could be making the client feel uncomfortable.

#### 5. Try to Be as Honest as Possible

Only give honest feedback to your developers. Remember, efficient feedback is the one that helps both your project and your workplace. If the feedback is negative, try not to sugarcoat it too much. This doesn't mean you have to be blunt. Be polite and help the developer understand what they have to change or improve.

### Receiving Feedback

Receiving feedback is as essential as giving it. No one is perfect at their job and taking some feedback can help you grow as a better developer. When receiving feedback, there are three things you must follow: be polite, be clear, be optimistic.

Try to appreciate any feedback, whether it is negative or positive. The person giving the feedback has nothing against you as a person and is only trying to help the project. If you don't think the feedback is valid for you, be as clear as possible. For instance, if you received some feedback on your behavior in a meeting with the client but you don't think the feedback is valid for you, tell the person you didn't notice this and that you will try not to repeat it in the future. Appreciate them for taking some time and helping you.

Be optimistic when receiving feedback. Try not to take the feedback personally and use it to help the project. Show your optimism about the feedback by using words like, “I appreciate you taking your time to help me grow” or  “I didn't realize it could be done this way. Thank you for informing me”.

If the feedback is too vague for you to follow, request the person for additional remarks on how to work on that feedback. You need to know what the manager expects from you when you receive feedback.

### How to Ask for Feedback?

Managers like nothing more than an employee who voluntarily asks for feedback. Generally, managers schedule weekly or monthly meetings to give feedback. If that structure is not present at your workplace, you can always ask your manager directly for feedback.

When asking for feedback, be as specific as possible. For instance, if you are looking for some feedback on your presentation to the client, give them the scenario you're referring to when asking for feedback.

Being specific helps the managers give feedback easily. Be careful how you're planning to ask for feedback. Request the person for a small meet when they're free. Check if everything is working before the meet. After all, you don't want to take more time out of their day.

You can either choose to ask for feedback in a meet or through texts depending on the dynamic at your workplace. When asking for feedback, take notes of everything the other person mentions.

## Common Pitfalls of the Feedback

Even though feedback can be quite helpful in many situations, it does have its share of disadvantages. When the feedback is not delivered right, it may lead to a lot of confusion and misunderstandings. The reason feedback is usually ineffective is because it's often too indirect. You must identify the right feedback from the wrong and use it to improve yourself.
