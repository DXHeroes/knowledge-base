# 16 personalities

**TL;DR**

16 personalities is a short personality test that helps with communication within the team and uncovers general strong points and weaknesses of every team member.

## What is 16 personalities

16personalities is a personality test analyzing the personal traits of the test-taker and putting those on a scale from 0 to 100. The corner values represent the very opposite sides of the spectrum for the given trait. The test distinguishes 5 different traits, namely:
- Mind - Introverted vs. Extroverted
- Energy - Observant vs. Intuitive
- Nature - Thinking vs. Feeling
- Tactics - Judging vs. Prospecting
- Identity - Assertive vs. Turbulent

The result of the test is 5 (4+1) (e.g. ENFP-T, also known as a [turbulent campaigner](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality) letters that identify one of 16 personalities, of which the site provides detailed information regarding the professional and personal relationships, strength suits, weaknesses and potential directions for further personal development.

## Why you should take the test

Reasons to take the test may be of all sorts - learning about yourself, your motivation, giving names to recurring patterns in your life, discovering personal features you might have not known of or learning how to work better with others. If you are on the verge whether to take it, the breaking point for you could be that the test takes at most about 15 minutes, can be done anywhere and, unless you opt for the premium version that costs money, it's free. In case you decide to get your whole team to take the test, the site gives you and your team members an opportunity to share the results.

## Problems it solves for teams

16personalities is a good choice for already existing teams to help team members work more effectively with each other and how to maximize the potential each team member possesses. Contrary to that, new teams about to be built can benefit from knowing general strong suits and weaknesses of team members which can lead to building more effective teams with good relationships. 

## Common pitfalls you might encounter

To every benefit there usually is a disadvantage and 16personalities is no different. It is important to keep in mind that it is still just a generalization and everyone is unique. Meaning that although two people can be the same type, they can also be very different given the spectrum they operate in. Lastly, the test builds heavily on traits, not skills, and thus we recommend to combine it with other test, such as Gallup, that analyze soft skills and mindset in more depth.
