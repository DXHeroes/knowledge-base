**TL;DR**

OKR that address your business needs and meet your business reality's nature.

## What Are Objectives and Key Results

Objective and Key Result (OKR) can be defined as a collective goal-setting tool used by corporate and individual businesses to set goals and measure the expected results. Effective use of OKRs helps organizations and individuals to track their business growth, create alignment, and improve engagement, focusing clearly on the stated goals.

You may wonder why vast companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and many companies use OKRs tools to set goals and accomplish them.

As much as OKRs are highly significant for businesses, so does it encourage personal development and essential interpersonal growth among individuals. Effective use of OKRs tools enables businesses and individuals to visualize their operations and track progress.

If you are not using OKR methodologies to facilitate your business activities, you are probably doing your business a great deal of disservice. If you are looking to understand how to make use of OKR, bother no further effect. Stick around, as I will explain how to benefit from it.

The term is composed of two different but connected variants.

**Objective (O)** entails what is set out to be achieved. The objective should be meaningful, plain, actionable, and time conscious. If effectively designed and implemented, it encourages timely execution and prevents excessive thought processes. It spans over a long period, sometimes a year or more.

**Key Results (KRs)** specified how you attain your objective. It helps to track your progress, measuring the expected outcomes. Productive KRs are distinct and timely, realistic, and measurable, and verifiable. Hence, there must be no shady outcome. You either accomplished a Key Results task, or you don't. Usually, by the end of a set-out period, checks and balances are carried out to measure the key results.

Unlike Objective, Key Results are continuously measured as the work progressed. Thus, to achieve your objectives, you need a set of Key Results ranging from three to five.


## Why You Might Want To Use OKR?

Many businesses are sometimes trapped in the misconceptions and misinterpretation of OKRs as an ordinary set of goals, especially when they are ignorant of the benefits of a new product or tool. It is of utmost importance to note that OKRs go deeper and highly precise in setting the goals and strategically achieving those goals.

That said. Since businesses thrive on the exchange of value for money, most businesses and individuals always want to know what they stand to benefit from a product or service before buying or opting for it. Likewise, before using a tool for business operation, you might want to know how useful to the success of your business it will be.

Hence, whether the idea is to improve your goals, that of your company, or even to suggest a new management tool to other leadership, then OKR is the perfect management strategy for you. Ideas are cheap; the execution, however, is everything. Why you need to use OKR;

- OKRs help you express your goals clearly and properly.
- OKRs help you keep track and measure progress.
- OKRs help you reassess and stretch.
- It turns good ideas into great execution.
- OKRs also drive high-performing teams and encourage engagement.
- OKRs help control time management and are result-oriented.

## Problems OKR Helps to Solve

Every day we develop strategies to solve our daily and common problems or difficulties. Sometimes, we use a method that has been proven to be effective before. Similarly, we are faced with organizational problems daily. To solve them, we either develop a quick solution or stick to an efficient method used in the past.

OKRs can solve a range of problems, but this will depend on how you implement them, how the organization embraces them and how individual teams use them. Effective use of OKRs help to promote goal clarity and find a solution to common challenges.

Below are some problems that OKRs help to solve.

- OKRs enable teams to stay aligned on a goal.
- Proper use of OKRs ensures a strong link between strategy and execution.
- Effective use of OKRs minimizes unnecessary work.
- Using OKRs reduces the problem of accountability in an organization.
- OKRs Highlight the need for lead measures of success

Where I’ve been involved in implementing OKRs, the drive was to promote goal clarity. We wanted everybody in the organization to understand how their work contributed to our strategy.

## How to Implement OKR

After understanding the basics of OKRs, the next step is implementation. Before implementing, it's important to do so in advance, starting a few weeks before the coming quarter to make the most out of the method.

As discussed earlier in this article, OKRs work for both individuals and organizations. As individuals, our daily routines, goals, and aspirations can better be achieved using OKRs. An effective OKR helps us achieve them effortlessly and reach an expected outcome. Likewise, an organization.

Looking at it from the perspective of the individual.

We can reference a profound example of John Doerr's interviews, where he was asked about his personal OKR. According to him;

    *"You know, my daughters have both left home, but I had read, and I believe that having family dinners together was a good thing. So, I set an OKR, shared it with my team to be home for dinner by 6:00 pm 20 nights a month, and be present, turning off the phone. I put a switch on the router. We shut down the internet to the entire house."*

    *“It’s not only the quantity but the quality,” he concluded.*

Doerr's personal goal would be written out like this:

- Objective:
  - Have more quality family time, as measured by:
- KR1:
  - Getting home for dinner by 6 pm, 20 nights a month.
- KR2:
  - Being present by turning off the internet router to eliminate distractions.

An important thing to note is Doerr's brilliant distribution of Objectives and expected Key results. Hence, a personal OKR should be clearly stated and an effort to achieve them.

Organizations' OKRs have little of a difference from personal OKRs. However, they might differ in the strategies implored. A specific company-wide OKRs should look like this:

- Objective:
  - A fifteen percent growth in revenues and earnings within the next 12 months
- KR1:
  - Increase in production of products by five percent in the first quarter.
- KR2:
  - Set strategy to increase distribution that reaches the rural areas.
- KR3:
  - Increasing capital and investments, such as attracting new shareholders and investors by improving creditworthiness and cash flow.

## Common Pitfalls of OKR

Everything with an advantage surely has disadvantages. OKRs are not an exemption. When you fail to implement OKRs, the result may be very devastating. In extreme cases, it frustrates the purpose of the objective and collapses the business.

Some common pitfalls usually encounter using OKRs are:

- Business as usual, OKR. It is a serious challenge team always fails to change anything despite setting the OKR.
- Inability to differentiate between aspirational and committed OKRs. Aspirational OKRs are impossible to attain but set a template for business growth. Committed OKRs are very much achievable and much be. Failure to differentiate between these two can cause huge limitations and setbacks to your business.
- Sandbagging. Effective, committed OKR should credibly consume most of its available resources but not all.
- Poorly rated objective. Otherwise known as "Who Cares" OKR. At a glance, some objectives are clumsy, lengthy, and not clear. Unless an OKR promises clear business value, we should not waste resources on it.
- Timid Aspirational OKR. If your Aspirational OKR doesn't meet the needs of your customers, then it's timid.
- Insufficient KRs for every Os. Every objective must have reasonable Key Results counting about two to four. If the measurable process does not align with the desired outcome, the OKR set is already defeated.

Pitfalls like this are unavoidable in setting or writing an OKR. However, if the listed mistakes resonate with you, you need to look into your OKR and probably set a new one.

Last note, the focus of every business and individual is to maximize profit and ensure growth. OKRs set strategic opportunities for your business and help you drive sales. When effectively applied, the result can be unimaginable. Writing OKRs doesn't have to be complicated; follow the OKR examples and key practices provided in this article to write effective OKRs for your business.

Your company doesn't have to suffer set back in achieving your set objectives. In situations where you fail, the strategy might be faulty. Hence, it would help if you changed to a new strategy. Also, you can employ OKRs tools and firms to carry out effective OKRs that address your company's needs and align with the company.
