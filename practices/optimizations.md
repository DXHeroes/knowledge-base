# Optimizations

**TL;DR**

Optimization is an process or methodolgy that is used to make something(for instance any program) to run faster(making it effective) while fulfilling its functionality normally.


## What Is an Optimization
The code optimization in the synthesis phase is a program transformation technique,in which the intermediate code is tend to be improved and thus will be consuming fewer resources (i.e. CPU, Memory), hence faster-running machine code will result.

## Why You Might Want the Optimization

Optimization overall helps to achieve the same goal with lower consumption of resources hence this practice should be followed.
So optimization helps to:

- High compilation speed and low consumption of space.
- Code optimizers are used to avoid overburn of manual optimization as it involves a lot of time.
- Re-usability can be achieved while following optimization.

## How to Implement the Optimization
1. **Optimize your Code using Appropriate Algorithm**
2. **Optimize Your Code for Memory**
4. **Using Operators** : Most basic operations like +=, -=, and *=, when applied on basic data types could slow down the program as well. 
5. **Problems with Functions** : For example, if you have a code like this, it might be a bad thing.
```
for(int i=1; i<=10; ++i)
     DoSomething(i);
``` 
6. **Optimizing Loops**
7. **Data Structure Optimization**

## Common Pitfalls of the Optimization

- Bigger code base is the major problem faced due to time based optimizations.
- Chances to improve and make code run faster never ends hence making Performance optimization a never-ending process.
- Coding standards are compromised sometimes to achieve optimization.
