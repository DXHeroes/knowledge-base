# Meaningful Meetings
**TL;DR** Meaningful Meetings are meetings with defined Goals, Agenda, Roles, Moderator and Outcomes. These meetings make your team members feel heard, understood and motivated to do their tasks.

## What are Meaningful Meetings?
Meaningful Meetings are spin-off on the classical, endless, and pointless meetings all people know and dislike. Meaningful Meetings are similar to change to meetings as Agile was to team leading. 

There are multiple roads to make your meetings meaningful. These roads have similar core — make meetings on-point where all relevant voices have a say. Meaningful meetings try to minimise time on meeting to give your team more time to work. 

## Why You Might Want Meaningful Meetings?

A minute in the meeting is a minute person doesn’t directly work. It is a minute of lost work time. Team members who must sit in poorly organised meetings keep thinking what is this meeting about? Why Am I here? Why are we wasting our time on this? In fact, [study from Salary.com](https://www.salary.com/chronicles/2013-wasting-time-at-work-survey/) reported that:” _Meetings topped the list with 19% of total respondents picking it as the biggest problem”_. It was never better time to change your meeting practices.

Meaningful Meetings change the concept of meetings. Through committing to Meaningful Meetings as practice you empower your team. You give a relevant voice to your team, make meetings trackable, and increase efficiency of your team. 

## Problems Meaningful Meetings Helps to Solve

* What is this Meeting About? 
* Cutting Meeting Expanses
* I am not heard feeling

## How to Implement Meaningful Meetings?

Committing to making meetings meaningful is a long run but even small practices can make the situation better. These practices can even improve your [Agile Events](https://developerexperience.io/practices/agile-events).

### Start with Reason for your Meeting

Important practice of Meaningful Meetings is always have a good reason for meetings. If you are unsure why you should have a meeting, dismiss it. 

Common Bad Reasons for meetings are (exclude if case of Agile Events):
- To update on information 
- Because it is scheduled and we always do it on X-day
- For team leader to monitor the process

All these bad reasons are solvable using Agile events and product management tools. They don’t need meeting at all.

Before you schedule meeting, have a clear goal. Know precisely why you and other people should _waste_ their work time on meeting.

### Create Meeting Agenda
Meeting Agenda is powerful and overlooked tool that rapidly improves meetings. The simplest way to create agenda is to write your Reason for Meeting. 

The Meeting Agenda explains what is this meeting about. 

#### Add relevant information to your Agenda
#### Add outcomes to your Agenda
#### Have design of your meeting ready

### Invite relevant people
### Maintain control over the meeting


## Common Pitfalls of Implementing Meaningful Meetings
- Meeting is not designed for your team
- Meeting organizators botch the meeting agenda
