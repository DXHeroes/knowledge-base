# Automated Deployment

**TL;DR**

If there is one golder rule in programming, it should be **to automate as much as possible**. An Automated Deployment ensures that the path your code has to take from development to production does not break its functionalities. Read more to learn how to make it a regular part of your Continuous Deployment.  

## What Is an Automated Deployment

An Automated Deployment is a practice that allows you to ship code automatically (or partially automatically) across various stages of the development process - from development to production. It contributes to more efficient and reliable deployments.

How do you know that the path your code has to take from development to production does not break its functionalities? To ensure that it does not happen, you should automate as much as possible. And for that, you need a deployment pipeline - the process of taking code from your version control (for example, git) and making it available to users of your application.

We can classify Automated Deployment approaches into different categories according to the level of automation coverage across environments:

1. **Continuous Integration**  
   Continuous Integration is a practice of daily integrating code changes. Everything that has been developed keeps integrating daily. Each integration is automatically and immediately verified and tested to detect possible errors.  
   For more information, see [Continuous integration](/practices/continuous_integration).
2. **Continuous delivery**  
   Continuous delivery is a practice of keeping the code in a deployable state at any given time. Continuous delivery is an extension of the continuous integration to automate release to the staging environment. You have a production-ready version of your build with the continuous delivery.
3. **Continuous Deployment**  
   Continuous deployment is a practice of fully automating the entire process of the deployment pipeline. Every change in the source code is deployed to production automatically and without explicit approval from a developer.

## Why You Might Want the Deployment to Be Automated

The Automated Deployment helps your team with:

- **Reducing the possibility of errors**  
  Manual deployment is error-prone. Any process involving human input introduces the possibility of errors.
- **Saving time**  
  Manual deployment is time-consuming. The job is often assigned to testers and developers in a development team who can otherwise spend their time working on improving the application.
- **Consistency and repeatability**  
  Once configured, the process is the same every time you initiate release. It contributes to more frequent and stable releases.

## How to Implement the Automated Deployment

Follow these steps to set up a basic deployment pipeline:

1. **Set up a Continuous Integration server**
   - Choose an existing server, such as [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), or [go.cd](https://www.gocd.org/).
   - Set up your first build (a link to your source code, for example, on GitHub and a command to build the application)
   - Ensure that it runs every time a change is checked into source control.
2. **Set up a few test suites**
   - Set up a separate build for each test suit and link the builds to one another so that each is triggered by the one before it. This way you see very quickly if there is some problem - the problematic code change stops at the first test that recognizes it and does not go any further.
3. **Add a deployment step**
   - On your Continuous Integration server, set a build that runs your script to deploy your application to a testing or staging environment. Ensure that it runs only when all the tests pass.

## Common Pitfalls of the Automated Deployment

- **Exaggerated reliance on the Automated Deployment**  
   It is always good to have an alternative strategy to avoid being stuck when your Automated Deployment configuration is broken.
- **The project is too small**  
   Implementing Automated Deployment can be time-consuming. Ensure that you do not spend more time implementing it than actually developing the product.
- **Rigid pipeline design**  
   Rigid pipeline prevents the team from optimizing their processes. Pipeline should be structured, flexible, and able to incorporate sudden changes.
- **Long and slow deployment pipelines**  
   There are too many steps between code commit and deployment.
