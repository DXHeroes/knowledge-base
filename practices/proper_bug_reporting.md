# Proper Bug Reporting

## What Is a Bug Report
Bug reports are the most important tools for developers. They are created by testers who test the product. It is necessary to build an independent test environment before letting the customers use the actual product. The quality of tests and the bug reports have a huge impact on the quality of product development. The bug report should contain all the information needed to document, report, and fix problems that occurred during testing the product.

## Why You Might Want the Bug Reporting
Bug reports exist to improve your product. It is worth the effort to learn how to write an efficient bug report.

A good bug reports:
- contain all the information the developer needs to fix the problems
- are an efficient form of communication between the person who reports the bug and the person who fixes it
- should be resolved as soon as possible
- enable cooperation between testers and developers
- help to reduce the number of problems

Bug reporting can be automatized or semi-automatized. Some of the most popular bug tracking software tools are [Airbrake](https://airbrake.io/), [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/), [Backlog](https://backlog.com/), [ReQtest](https://reqtest.com/), or [Bugzilla](https://www.bugzilla.org/).

## How to Implement the Bug Reporting
To write an effective bug report, follow these 10 steps:
1. **Condense**
  Be clear and brief. Ensure that every information in the bug report is relevant.
2. **Accurate**
  Ensure that you are reporting a real bug. The problem can be a setup problem, user error or just a misunderstanding of a product. It is better to consult with a more experienced tester than reporting a mistake that is not a bug.
3. **Neutralize**
  Do not use emotionally charged statements. The report has to be neutral, professional, and factual. 
4. **Precise**
  Try to be as explicit as possible. Summarize the problem at the beginning. The goal is to write a description that cannot be misunderstood.
5. **Isolate**
  Isolate the problem. If possible, describe what inputs trigger the bug.
6. **Generalize**
  Try to find out if the bug is more general than it seems. Sometimes the bug occurs at multiple locations - the bug needs a more general fix.
7. **Re-create**
  If it is possible, describe how to re-create the bug. List all the steps, describe the environment.
8. **Impact**
  If it is not obvious, describe the impact on the customer.
9. **Debug**
  What does the developer need to be able to debug the problem? For example, are there any logs he needs?
10. **Evidence**
  Provide documentation that can prove the existence of the bug. 

## Common Pitfalls of Proper Bug Reporting
- **Underestimated bug reporting**
  For example, some websites do not offer any opportunity to report a bug. If you find a bug, you cannot submit feedback or contact the person who can fix it.
- **Untraceable bug**
  The developer did not get enough information to fix the bug or cannot meet the mandatory conditions (for example, a regulator that can capture every clientâ€™s reaction).
- **The team does not react**
  The developers get the bug reports, but do not fix the bugs efficiently.
- **Too much information**
  If the bug report is too detailed, it can be difficult to understand. It also increases the time and energy of the people who have to read the report. 
- **Too vague**
  It is necessary to find a balance between being too vague and too detailed. It saves time when the person who has to fix the bug does not have to ask for more information.
