# Technical Writing

**TL;DR** Tech Writing is the practice of documenting software, hardware, or process to make the work easier through welcoming colaboration, both external and internal. As Tech Writer, you manage knowledge and information in your team.

## What Is Technical Writing 

Usually, Technical writing is generally understood through [Documentation](/practices/documentationes). In short, documentation is a tool that simplifies information sharing. Tech Writer is the one who is responsible to create documentation. They keep information up to day, are responsible for content quality (see [Documentation testing](/practices/documentation-testing))

But that is not all Tech writing can do. Together with UX team he can help with Labeling, Descriptions and more. If you have experienced TW, they can take a part of [UX strategy](/practices/ux-strategy).

However, the more significant things Tech Writing does are: Improvements to [DX](/practices/good-developer-experience) and Improvements to Developer Acquisition. A good tool - if it is API, [SDK](practices/software-development-kit) or whole Dev Portal or a software product, needs to have documentation. Even the simplest UI still needs some way of telling you what to do with it. Labels, description - these are as well part of documentation (together, they fall under Information Architecture, which is an umbrella term designing information)
