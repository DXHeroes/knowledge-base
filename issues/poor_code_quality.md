# Poor Code Quality

## What the Poor Code Quality Is?

Poor code quality is an umbrella term for multiple issues with the codebase:

- Code that exhibits buggy behavior
- Slow implementation
- Messy code with high coupling and low cohesion (a.k.a. spaghetti code)
- Unmaintainable code
- Usage of obsolete libraries/frameworks
- Code repetition that leads to costly refactoring

If left unchecked, poor code quality can lead to issues in software delivery. It can bring the development to a halt and if the root causes are not addressed, it can lead to long periods of refactoring or a complete rewrite.

## Reasons of the Poor Code Quality

**Team Culture**

Poor code quality can be caused by a team that "doesn't give a shit". Make sure that the team knows their purpose.

Another reason may be a lack of senior expertise within the team.

Poor code quality can be caused by long-term technical debt accumulation, give the team some time for refactoring the code and pay-off the technical debt.

**Processes**

No or weak quality assurance practices can lead to poor code quality rather quickly.

- Make sure, your team does code review and pull requests.
- Introduce unit tests and code coverage to catch bugs early in development.
- Implement CI/CD so that code has to pass all the tests before it can be merged.
- Add testers into the team and employ manual testing
- Ensure that your software development methodology (SCRUM/Kanban) leaves enough time for refactoring and writing a production quality code. Decrease the workload on the team and see if the code quality improves

**Architecture**

Architecture that has a bad fit with the requirements of the software being written can be the cause for poor code quality.

Make sure your architecture supports code reuse if you have a problem with code repetition.

The particular functionality you are trying to deliver can be hard to implement within your current architecture leading to verbose/buggy/hard to maintain code. Try to modify the architecture so it fits the use case.
