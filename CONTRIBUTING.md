### Content Composition

**Repository folders**
- There are 3 important folders in the root of the repository:
  - [**files**](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/files) - stores all images and other files necessary for articles (issue/practice)
  - [**issues**](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/issues) - stores all DX issues
  - [**practices**](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/practices) - stores all DX practices

**File Format**
- Articles are written in [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- Names of the file should be [snake_cased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) (`lower_case_with_underscores`)
- Put your file to correct folder based on the type of your article ([issue](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/issues)/[practice](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/practices)). E.g. practice pull request [on the Knowledge Base](https://developerexperience.io/practices/pull-requests) and [in the repository](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/blob/master/practices/pull_requests.md)

**Content Format**

  - **aspect** - Categorizes the article to some [aspect](https://developerexperience.io/aspects#explore) of the development process. Valid values are: 
    - `architecture`
    - `processes`

      - `Why You Might Want the %{name}`
      - `Issues the %{name} Helps to Solve`
      - `How to Implement the %{name}?`
      - `Common Pitfalls of the %{name}`
      - `Resources for the %{name}`

### The Chicago Manual of Style on Headlines    
**Principles of headline-style capitalization.** The conventions of headline style are governed mainly by emphasis and grammar. The following rules, though occasionally arbitrary, are intended primarily to facilitate the consistent styling of titles mentioned or cited in text and notes:
  1. Capitalize the first and last words in titles and subtitles (but see rule 7), and capitalize all other major words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and some conjunctions–but see rule 4).
  2. Lowercase the articles the, a, and an.
  3. Lowercase prepositions, regardless of length, except when they are used adverbially or adjectivally (up in Look Up, down in Turn Down, on in The On Button, to in Come To, etc.) or when they compose part of a Latin expression used adjectivally or adverbially (De Facto, In Vitro, etc.).
  4. Lowercase the conjunctions and, but, for, or, and nor.
  5. Lowercase to not only as a preposition (rule 3) but also as part of an infinitive (to Run, to Hide, etc.) and lowercase as in any grammatical function.
  6. Lowercase the part of a proper name that would be lowercased in the text, such as de or von.
  7. Lowercase the second part of a species name, such as fulvescens in Acipenser fulvescens, even if is the last word in a title or subtitle.

**Examples of headline-style capitalization.** The following examples illustrate the numbered rules in 8.157. All of them illustrate the first rule; the numbers in parentheses refer to rules 2-7.
