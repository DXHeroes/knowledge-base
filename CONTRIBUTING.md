### Feeling and Grammar

- Use active voice whenever possible

  - For example If ... => to avoid...
  - Important information in the main clause

### Content Composition

**Repository folders**
- There are 3 important folders in the root of the repository:
  - [**files**](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/files) - stores all images and other files necessary for articles (issue/practice)
  - [**issues**](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/issues) - stores all DX issues
  - [**practices**](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/practices) - stores all DX practices

**File Format**
- Articles are written in [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- Names of the file should be [snake_cased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) (`lower_case_with_underscores`)
- Put your file to correct folder based on the type of your article ([issue](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/issues)/[practice](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/tree/master/practices)). E.g. practice pull request [on the Knowledge Base](https://developerexperience.io/practices/pull-requests) and [in the repository](https://github.com/DXHeroes/knowledge-base/blob/master/practices/pull_requests.md)

**Content Format**

- **markdown content**
  - everything behind the second `---`
  - **headlines**
    - first H1 is recognized as the name of the article
    - We want to keep similar structure of all articles informing about the practice or issue. So we require to keep only few specific H2 headings:
      - `What Is a %{name}`
      - `Why You Might Want the %{name}`
      - `Issues the %{name} Helps to Solve`
      - `How to Implement the %{name}?`
      - `Common Pitfalls of the %{name}`
      - `Resources for the %{name}`
    - Use "The Chicago Manual of Style on Headlines". Go to  [https://capitalizemytitle.com](https://capitalizemytitle.com) and choose "Chicago".
